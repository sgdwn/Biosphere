Hi I'm Ella! I'm a final year biomed student and just did a year abroad in Groningen in the Netherlands. After my BSc, I'm planning to continue studying for a masters focusing on neuroscience. Outside of uni, I love to play guitar and got the chance to perform my own songs this summer which was terrifying but so fun!
