# Biosphere

Created by a small group of students, Biosphere is the university's first student-led platform that brings together students and ideas from all across the biosciences.

Our aim is to create a supportive community where you can explore academic interests, delevop new ideas, and accesses opportunities to actively engage with industry beyond the classroom.
