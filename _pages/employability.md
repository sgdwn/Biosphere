# Internships and Employment

It's no secret that the grad job market is tough right now. With articles of students applying for a countless number of roles, and the number of applicants per open position at all time highs, it can be difficult to stand out from the crowd. To help you find support and build your professional skills, we have linked univeristy resources and some of our own to help give you an edge. 

## Internships, Summer Schools and Work Experience

Internships are not only a great way to gain hands on experience on a role or field you may be interested in, but can also help you develop key transferable skills. 
 
There are many opportunities out there, however some are more well-hidden than others. Our team has gathered a list to help you find them, including ones that have already accepted our members in the past, so you have more chance of securing a role!
